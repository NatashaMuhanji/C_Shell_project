This is a simple shell group project.
This project is done through pair programming with a collaborator.

SIMPLE SHELL
The shell is a program that takes keyboard commands and executes them via talking with the operating system.

The project is written in the C programming language and seeks to imitate many functions of a genuine shell.

It comprises basic functions such as;
-presenting a prompt
and waiting for user input.
-launching executable programs.
-built-in commands.
-processing commands with arguments,
-managing the PATH variable,
-handling the End Of File (EOF) situation 
and handling the Ctrl + C signal.

This shell project includes a list of the files and comments within the files that describe their functionality.
