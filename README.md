# SimpleShell Project

This is a SimpleShell project written in C. It implements a basic shell that allows you to execute commands and manage processes.

## Features

- Execute commands and programs
- Handle basic shell functionalities (e.g., changing directories, environment variables)
- Support for command execution in the background
- Built-in commands (e.g., `cd`, `exit`)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- GCC Compiler
- Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS)

### Clone the Repository

```shell
git clone <repository-url> 

Compile the Code
cd SimpleShell
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o simpleshell

Run the Shell
./simpleshell

Usage
Once the shell is running, you can enter commands just like in a regular shell. Some examples include:

Executing a program: ls -l
